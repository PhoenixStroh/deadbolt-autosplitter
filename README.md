# deadbolt-autosplitter
An unofficial attempt at creating an autosplitter for the game DEADBOLT. 

---

## Uses
Currently there is only one autosplitter for the **Any% Category**. This autosplitter can only detect when you return to home base, and will accidentally split if you exit a level pre-maturally.

---

#### Any% Category
This Autosplitter has a few caveats: 
 - The starting split is slightly slower then what you can click. 
 - It will not split for the tutorial, so please do not include it as a split. 
 - I cannot guarentee that it will split for the last chair given that the address used doesn't switch between two values, but rather generates a new, completely different value each time. I'm not sure if this means that the value can be chance switch to the same value.
