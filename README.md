#####This Autosplitter has a few caveats: 
 - The starting split is slightly slower than what you can click. 
 - If you exit the level while the level's mission has been completed, it will split. 

#####Settings: 
 - *Skip Tutorial* 
   - If enabled, will avoid splitting when exiting the tutorial. 
 - *Complete Mission Safetyguard* 
   - If enabled, will not split if the current mission has not been completed.
