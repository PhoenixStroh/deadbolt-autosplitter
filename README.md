# deadbolt-autosplitter
An unofficial attempt at creating an autosplitter for the game DEADBOLT. 

### Uses
Currently there is only one autosplitter for the **Any% Category**. This autosplitter can only detect when you return to home base, and will accidentally split if you exit a level pre-maturally.
